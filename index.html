        <p><span class="initcap">E</span>ver since I was a kid I've loved stealing an afternoon to read. It's a wonderful feeling having stolen time and nowhere to go except into the pages of a story or a poem. It's like meeting your lover for an afternoon rendezvous, perhaps somewhere illicit like a motel room. I hope you find that sort of enjoyment here, reading my words.</p>
